## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.3.x or higher
- Rails 7.1+ or higher
- SQLite3
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rails-api-backend.git
cd rails-api-backend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
bundle install
```

3. **Setup database**
```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

4. **Run tests to verify setup**
```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

5. **Start the development server**
```bash
rails server
```

## Coding Standards

### Ruby Style Guide

We follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/). Key points:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Keep lines under 120 characters
- Use snake_case for methods and variables
- Use CamelCase for classes and modules
- Add comments for complex logic

### RuboCop

We use RuboCop for code quality. Before committing:

```bash
# Check for violations
bundle exec rubocop

# Auto-fix violations (when possible)
bundle exec rubocop -a
```

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Use RSpec for testing
- Use FactoryBot for test data
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

**Test Structure:**
```ruby
RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
  describe 'validations' do
    it 'requires a name' do
      user = build(:user, name: nil)
      expect(user).not_to be_valid
    end
  end
end
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update API documentation in `docs/` folder
- Include examples in documentation

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(posts): add filtering by multiple tags

Add ability to filter posts by multiple tags using comma-separated values.
Example: /posts?tags=ruby,rails

Closes #123
```

```
fix(users): validate email format

Add email format validation to prevent invalid email addresses.
```

```
docs(readme): update installation instructions

Add Windows-specific setup steps and troubleshooting section.
```

### Commit Best Practices

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Don't end subject line with a period
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Wrap body at 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests in the footer
